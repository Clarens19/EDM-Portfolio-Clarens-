# Finals Task 3-1: Using SELECT CLAUSE
- In this task, you will work with a MySQL database called online_courseDB, which contains a table named courses. This table stores information about online courses, including details like the course name, category, enrollment limit, and the number of students enrolled. You will execute a series of SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data based on specific requirements. The following steps outline the process to complete the task.
  
## Step 1: Create and Use the Database and then Create Table for courses
The first step is to create the database called online_courseDB and switch to it for further use. Next is to copy paste the online_courses.sql

## Step 2: Retrieve All Courses with Enrolled Students Less Than the Enrollment Limit
- Next, you will write a query to select all courses where the number of students enrolled is less than the enrollment limit.

## Step 3: Group Courses by Category and Calculate the Total Number of Students Enrolled in Each Category
In this step, you will group the courses by their category and calculate the total number of students enrolled for each category.

## Step 4: Retrieve Courses That Are Fully Enrolled
For this task, you will write a query to retrieve the courses that are fully enrolled (i.e., where the number of students enrolled is equal to the enrollment limit).

## Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Students Enrolled Across All Courses
In this step, you will calculate the total number of students enrolled across all courses in the database.

## Step 6: Sort Courses by Students Enrolled in Ascending Order
Lastly, you will write a query to sort all courses by the number of students enrolled, in ascending order (from the least enrolled to the most enrolled).
